# Bioinformatics-finding_Short_Tandem_Repeats

This is a project for a graduate course (Bioinformatics)

>The fasta file contains the sequences considered for running the code on.

>The code for this project was written in jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and exported as a python file (.py)

>dictionaryforproject.txt shows all combination of di- and tri- nucleotides screened for in the sequences. 
These occur in repeats of at least 3 (e.g "ATATAT") to be considered as short tandem repeats (STRs)
